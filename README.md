# FIFA-playerValuation
This project uses the FIFA-19 dataset obtained from Kaggle and used to train a Machine Learning model to predict the values of players in the currently inflated market. The algorithms are coded in python and predictions are made after all the abilities are examined for a player. 
Accuracy obtained was approximately 98% for our model.
